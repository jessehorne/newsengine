News Engine
===

An open source headless news outlet platform.

# Features

* User accounts
* Administrative tooling
* OAuth (Google & Facebook)
* Article management
* Useful stats

# Motivation

As we know, despite our planet being extremely populated, we can count how many news sources we have access to on one or two hands. I'm creating News Engine to help make it easier for others to get into the game.
